    "### Deallocating Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very important practice of allocating and deallocating memory so that the space used can be used for any other instance. To perform this deallocation, first let us understand where the space is stored in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 kinds of memory that we look at they are a) Stack  b) Heap\n",
    "1. Stack - It is the area which is primarily dedicated to function calls. This is basically for local variables and hence once the function ends the memory is deallocated\n",
    "2. Heap  - It is the area which stores gloabal variable and hence the memory should be deallocated manually\n",
    "The manual deallocation work has it's own pain points of deallocation memory, hence the GOLang added a feature which typically identifies and deals with the deallocation of memory. This is called the **Garbage Collector**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garbage Collector** typicalls tracks the variable. Hence whenever all the pointers of the variable are out of use the garbage collector gets rid of the memory allocated. GO compiler determines which variable has to go to stack and which has to go to heap. This way if the variable is in stack the life of the variable finishes with the function call and if we are using variable in heap all the pointers assoiciated with the variable should be tracked and then eventually is deallocated with the help of the active garbage collector\n",
    "\n",
    "*note:* There is however a downside to garbage collector, because of a active garbage collector it slows things down a teeny tiny bit but it is worth the trade off"
