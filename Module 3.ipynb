    "## Module 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite datatypes\n",
    "Congregation of other datatypes to acheive the complex datatypes to solve any problem. Thesse datatypes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arrays**\n",
    "   * Fixed length of elements which all belong to the same datatype\n",
    "   * They are stored in a sequential order\n",
    "   * Array is initialized to zero if it is int or float and \"\" if it is string \n",
    "   ```go\n",
    "   var lengthy [5] int\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Array Literal**\n",
    "    * An array predefined with values\n",
    "    ```go\n",
    "var x [5] int = [5]{1,2,3,4,5}\n",
    "var x [5] int = [...]{1,2,3,4,5}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    * ... can help in letting the compiler understand the length of the array\n",
    " To iterate through the array we do as follows:\n",
    " ```go\n",
    "for i, v range x{\n",
    "    fmt.Printf(\"ind %d, val %d\", i,v)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "_note the range function returns 2 values( index, value at index) for iterating through the array\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Slices**\n",
    "    * Slice is a piece of the array that already exists.\n",
    "    * Slice unlike array it can change the size with max at length of the array it is dependent on\n",
    "    * Slice contains a pointer pointing to the first index; length determining the length of the slice; capacity captures the actual length the slice could scale up to\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```go\n",
    "arr:= [...]string{\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"d\",\"r\",\"g\"}\n",
    "s1:= arr[1:3]\n",
    "s2:= arr[2:5]\n",
    "len(s1) //gives out the length of the slice\n",
    "cap(s1) //returns the max capacity of the source array\n",
    "```\n",
    "> output: 3,6\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the slices we do arrayName[index]\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Slice Literals**\n",
    "    similar to that of the array literal but we don't mention the size of the slice, it assumes this to be slice and points directly to the slice\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```go\n",
    "sli := []int{1,2,3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way to perform slicing over the existing array, this is done using a function called **make()**. The make function can either be called 2/3 arguments \n",
    "* 2 arguments - type and length\n",
    "* 3 arguments - type, length and capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another function to add values to the slice, it is **append()**. Unlike any language we cannot add value to an array, the slicing here helps in increasing the length of the slice\n",
    "*note: using the append function helps us in increasing the size greater than the underlying array size*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hash Tables**\n",
    "    * Contains key/value pairs, where key is unique and value is the associated to the key\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Hash function is used to generate the key to put the value that is to be inserted.( this is not called explicitly)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The value can be accessed using key rather than the index of the value\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* Faster lookup than lists\n",
    "* Arbitary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* May have collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Maps\n",
    "* Implementation of hash table\n",
    "* We use make() to create a map\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "var idmap map[string]int\n",
    "idmap = make(map[string]int)\n",
    "\n",
    "idmap:=map[string]int{\"Joe\":123}\n",
    "\n",
    "idmap[\"Jane\"] = 456 //adding a value\n",
    "delete(idmap,\"Joe\") //deleting a value\n",
    "id, p:= idmap[\"Jane\"] // here p is the boolean returning if jane exists\n",
    "len(idmap) // gives the length of the map\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash tables implementation in GOLang is carried out using the map function and to iterate through the map is done as follows:\n",
    "```go\n",
    "for key,val:=range idmap{\n",
    "    fmt.Println(key,val)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Structs**\n",
    "    * It is basically a organized set of different variable for organizational problem solving.\n",
    "    * It is similar to that of the struct from C Language\n",
    "   \n",
    "```go\n",
    "    type struct Person {\n",
    "    name string\n",
    "    addr string\n",
    "    phone string\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "var p1 Person\n",
    "\n",
    "p1.name = \"joe\"\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 := new(Person) // creates a new value to be entered\n",
    "p1 := Person(name:\"Joe\", addr:\"1222121\", phone:\"98789\")  //initializing using a struct literal\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "_We use dot notation to access the variable_"
